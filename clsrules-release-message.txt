Hello everyone,

I have put together a new release of eprinttools (including doi2eprintxml) 
that has the additional customization requested.  The release 
number is v0.0.21 and available (Thursday, Aug 15th) at 

    https://github.com/caltechlibrary/eprinttools/releases/latest.  

If there is interest I can be available at the next Tools Incubator 
Meeting (Aug 21st, 10:00am) to answer questions and help install
the updated version of doi2eprintxml.

All the best,

Robert
