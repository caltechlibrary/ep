Good Morning everyone,

I have a working command line tool that will queries both CrossRef and DataCite and generates an EPrint XML document suitable for importing into EPrints. I will continue testing today and have a release ready Monday for installation.

The application is a command line program. It will run on will run on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux (both Intel and ARM). The tool is tailored to
CaltechAUTHOR's data practices as opposed to the general EPrints' community mappings (e.g. DOI are in the related URL field not in the DOI field). I am picking up more data than the old DOI import plugin because I am using CrossRef's and DataCite's newer public API. An example is CrossRef funder information is now being picked up.

I have hooks for adding some additional data interpretation. But they are currently turned off. Depending on feed back I think we can implement
Local Group detection (from affiliation values), improved name normalization and possibly Keyword generation.

Outstanding Data issues:

* Subtitles aren't populated from either CrossRef or DataCite metadata
* Abstracts aren't populated from CrossRef metadata
* Keywords aren't identified from CrossRef or DataCite metadata
* Local Group identification
* Publisher, Publication, Series and Volume could be better mapped normalized
* Name detection and mapping could be improve (e.g. detecting Corporate authors versus individuals)


Roadmap:

* Add "Local Groups" detection
* Add EPrint Author IDs mapping for exact author/orcid matches
* Integration of other data sources (e.g. Dimensions data to identify which individuals are "Caltech" or integrating with our Caltech Directory person harvest)

thanks,

Robert
