# EPrints Feeds

This is a collection of feeds and search services generate from an EPrints Repository. The following is a brief description of 
the tree structure used to organize the feeds.

## The branches

Each directory under the root is a branch.  The following branches are generated by the *genpages* tool.

+ [/recent](/recent/articles.html) - content sorted by descending publication date, limited to 25 items
+ /persons/ORCID_OR_ISNI - content of a person (author) in repository
+ /person/ORCID_OR_ISNI/recent - content sorted by descending publication date, limited to 25 items

Additionally you can use a search the feed contents at

+ [/search/](/search/)

At this time search only provides an HTML view. This will likely change in the future.


## The leafs

Feeds come in several formats. Currently the supported formats are 

+ .html (standard webpage)
+ .include (an HTML fragement suitable to include directly in other sites)
+ .rss (RSS formatted feed)
+ .json (a JSON representation)
+ .bib (a BibTeX representation)

Each format is used to represents a leaf which come in two types

+ publications, a list of publications (e.g. articles, presentations, book chapters)
+ articles.*, a list of articles (a subset of publications)

## Example

Finding an RSS feed of recent articles for someone with an ORCID of 0000-0002-1576-1676 would look like
