# command line tools

+ [ep](ep.html) is the second generation of an eprint harvester tool, it will write harvest content to a [dataset](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dataset)
+ [eputil](eputil.html) is the new harvester, it only talks to the REST API with the option of returning a JSON document, this can be piped into a [dataset](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dataset) if needed
+ [doi2eprintxml](doi2eprintxml.html) is a CaltechAUTHORS centric DOI to EPrint XML document generator 

## Roadmap for _eputil_

+ _eputil_ add support for importing content to an EPrint repository
+ _eputil_ add support for updating existing EPrint records (e.g. adding ORCID to creator items for a given author)
