Hello everyone,

I've updated the author list import rules per yesterday's 
Tools Incubator meeting (2020-02-18).  Now if you are importing
from CrossRef/DataCite and generating EPrints XML the full author
list will be generated in the EPrints XML (e.g. An astronomy paper
with 700 authors will have all of them listed in the EPrints XML).
This change is available as of v0.0.58 release of EPrints tools.

    https://github.com/caltechlibrary/eprinttools/releases/latest.  

Let me know if you need help updating your installation or have
questions about the tool.  

To check your version of doi2eprintxml you can use the `--version`
option

    doi2eprintxml --version

It should show the new version if you've successfully installed it.

All the best,

Robert
